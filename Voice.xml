    <Say>You have reached the Pursuit employee information line. The Pursuit plant will reopen on Monday, May 4th. Some departments will start on Monday, others on Tuesday. Your supervisor will contact you to give you your start day and time. We will be working Friday. The Pursuit Cafe will be closed so plan accordingly.
    Thank you.</Say>
