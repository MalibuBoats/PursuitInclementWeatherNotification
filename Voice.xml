    <Say>You have reached the Pursuit information line. The Pursuit plant, as well as all locations, will remain closed thru April 12th. Status updates will be sent out on Wednesdays. You are eligible to apply for temporary unemployment compensation. File a claim online at connect dot myflorida.com. Use April 3rd as last day worked. Thank you and be safe.</Say>
