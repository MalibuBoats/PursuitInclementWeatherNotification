    <Say>You have reached Pursuit's Employee Message Line. The plant will be closed tomorrow, Wednesday, 9/28 due to Hurricane Ian. Work on Thursday is to be determined. The management team will monitor the storm and decide on Wednesday by 6pm if the plant will be open and if employees will be working on Thursday. Friday will be a work day for all employees. Please call back on Wednesday after 6pm for a update on work for Thursday. Be safe.  Thank you</Say>
